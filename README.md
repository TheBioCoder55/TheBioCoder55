## Hi there 👋

# 👩‍💻 Hi, I'm The BioCoder 🌿💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I come from a Life Sciences background and I'm currently diving deep into the world of data analytics and digital tools. This is where I share my journey of learning, creating, and exploring the intersection of science and data.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning:
- SQL (joins, CTEs, subqueries)
- Power BI (dashboard creation, DAX)
- Python (beginner level – for data analysis)
- Structured Problem Solving
- Statistics & Excel Analytics

---

## 🛠️ Tools I Use:
- Power BI
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Functions)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Canva (content creation)
- GitHub

## 🎯 Goals
- Become a data analyst with strong storytelling skills
- Inspire learners from non-tech backgrounds

## ⚡ Fun Fact:
I used to decode biology; now I decode data — both tell you how things work, if you know where to look.
